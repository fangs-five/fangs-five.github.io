# **Case Stud**ies

## Low-budget case study

### Overview

This case study was performed on a real organization, a restaurant,
whose name will remain redacted. For this case study, we use our
Excel-based organizer. The primary goal is to prove that we can generate
metrics for each category regardless of the organizer. The benefit of
using the organizer is that it automates the aggregate data.

The secondary goal is to prove that, if the implementation of each
section ever changes (for example, the business logic that drives the
Risk Score), the framework as an abstraction will still have merit. This
second goal is crucial for the framework overall; it ensures that a
consultant has the flexibility they need to modify the framework in
whatever way best fits their clients.

### Information-gathering phase

With the help of the organization, the authors of this document were
able to gather necessary metrics. For example:

- On average, the organization receives about 5 - 30 patrons. This implies that, on busier nights, the potential for a threat actor to “blend in with the crowd” may prove easier.

- On average, between 3 and 5 customers are on the “guest” network at any given time. This implies that it may be easier to balance the load of any group on the network at a given time. It also implies that it may prove easier to identify a threat actor using nothing but “triangulation,” using the actual wireless signal strength from
  all routers in order to identify a person in the physical building.

- Orders are mostly managed through a Toast application. This allows customers to place their own order at any time. The service staff will see new orders and bring them to the bar or tables. The organization does have one point-of-sale system, an electronic Square interface, which has no lockout policy.

- No ethernet or hardwire ports are available for the general public. This is a good thing because, as a “game oriented” establishment, sometimes ethernet is provided for LAN parties or for optimized network speeds. By not offering this as an option, the organization prevents that attack vector from being abused by a malicious actor.

- The organization uses three routers. Two of them are reserved for use by the customers. One is tied to a private subnet which is restricted to employee-only use. Although they did not yield what the pre-shared key (password) is, they did agree that it was “guessable if someone really, really tried.”

- Port 22 (FTP) appears on Nmap scans as **Filtered**. This is a red flag as FTP is an insecure protocol. An attacker who can intercept this traffic will be able to see the plaintext contents of any messages or files. However, a filtered port is typically infeasible to attack via common methodologies; this may slow down an attacker who is trying unconventional methodologies of attacking the port or the underlying FTP service (the application or service itself), but the contents are nonetheless visible.

Although these points are not comprehensive, they should provide the
reader with a clear idea of the size and scope of the organization.

To build on these findings, we performed a network scan, which yielded
the following results:

```

```

The organization wished that we limit our activity on their network. So,
this case study will stop short here. The reader is encouraged to
consider a true “threat modeling” any time they assess the network.

### Using the Framework (visualizer)

In the first test case, a real organization’s security posture is
assessed. The consultant is able to take inventory and perform security
reconnaissance to gather the relevant information. Their findings are
entered into the organizer as shown in the following figure.



In this case, the correct **Totals** were generated: cost to fix, hours
of effort (estimated), and the risk score (out of 59 possible points).

Next, the organization’s network is assessed and documented in the
following figure.



The data shows that this network is fairly well put together. The
biggest blind spot is the download speeds. The consultant will encourage
the organization to upgrade their internet speeds. Doing so will allow
the organization’s Wi-Fi network to remain stable during peak hours with
many customers. This holds true to the framework’s goal with respect to
infrastructure improvements.

The report should present an aggregate of all data, along with a
high-level visual of the different questions from each dimension. This
is shown in the following figure.



### Next steps

In this case study, the organization was willing to sit down and
consider their security posture. The organization stakeholders were
appreciative for the opportunity to consider these weak points more in
depth and to look ahead at possible changes to the worksite. Although a
true implementation plan was not covered in this case study, we
recommended the following next steps:

- Move the service on port 22 to a non-standard port (above port 1023). The idea of a potential FTP server is seductive to a novice attacker. As this organization is close to a university, the potential for “script kiddies” and other amateur attackers is very high. Likewise, a conversation was held about the use of FTP, although this will not be repeated here.

- Update the password. If the employees found the password weak, the administrator should update it to a hardened, unguessable value. This could be stored in a password wallet, which is shared among owners or managers, and distributed or used on a needs basis. A 24-character pre-shared key, generated by a tool like Bitwarden or 1Password, is preferred to a simple, guessable one. To complement this, a password policy was recommended, which the stakeholders have taken into consideration.

- Update the ethernet cables. Many of the cables had been in use for about a decade. By replacing them with modern cables, the organization can be prepared for any future workloads which may stress the network.

- Set a lock-timeout for the digital point-of-sale system. Doing so will prevent unauthorized access to the system over a short period of time. Since the PoS system is not really used (compared to the Toast application), there is no great business reason to keep this unlocked for a generous amount of time.
